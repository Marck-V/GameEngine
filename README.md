# GameEngine
 
I created a small 2D game engine as to learn more about how games work under the hood. This project was created from part of a [course](https://pikuma.com/courses/cpp-2d-game-engine-development).

Here is a small image of what the final product looked like:

- This engine uses SDL2, ImGui, Sol, Glm, and spdlog as part of its foundation.
